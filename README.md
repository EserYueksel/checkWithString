This app prompts the user to enter a word containing the characters 'X' or 'O', 
and then checks whether the word contains the same number of 'X' and 'O' characters. 
The app uses a function called stringTask to count the number of 'X' and 'O' characters 
in the given word and return true if they are equal, and false otherwise. 
The result of this check is then printed to the console.
